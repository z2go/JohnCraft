JohnCraft is a game based off of Minecraft but I made it. 

It incorperates aspects of minecraft such as crafting, mixed with other unique features such as a unique world generation system, and hand-made sprites. 
It is programmed entirely in C++ due to its speed. 

Current features include:
Walking, Crafting, Armor, Weapons, Breaking Blocks, Inventory and unique sprites that I made myself.

Future Features include:
Sounds, projectiles, diverse combat, more layers and dimensions
